                    The Perseid Meteor Shower is one of the most spectacular annual meteor showers.
                    In 2024, the peak is expected to occur on the nights of August 12th and 13th.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Observers can expect to see up to 100 meteors per hour under clear, dark skies.
                    The Perseids are known for their bright meteors and long, lingering trails.

            <h2>Predicted Peak</h2>
            <ul>
                Predicted peak: The peak is predicted** for 14 UTC on August 12, 2024. So the mornings of August 11 and 12 are probably your best bets. August 13 might be good as well, but be aware that the Perseids tend to fall off rapidly after their peak
            </ul>
            <h2>Radiant</h2>
            <ul>The radiant rises in the middle of the night and is highest at dawn. </ul>
