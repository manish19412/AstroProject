                <p>On December 31, 2024, a special Full Moon, known as a Blue Moon, will grace the night sky. Despite its name, a Blue Moon is not actually blue in color but refers to the occurrence of a second full moon within a single calendar month or, in this case, the second full moon in a season.</p>
                <p>This Blue Moon will be the perfect way to end 2024. It will be visible across the globe, offering a rare chance to observe this celestial event. The Blue Moon is a beautiful spectacle and a rare phenomenon that occurs roughly once every 2.5 years.</p>
                <p>For the best viewing experience, find a location with minimal light pollution and clear skies. As the moon rises, it will cast a soft, silvery light, making it a perfect night for moon gazing and reflection as we close out the year.</p>
